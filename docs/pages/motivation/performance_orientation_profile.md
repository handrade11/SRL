The scenario below explores the performance orientation profile of a fictional college student, Janet. Click on the links below to read about Janet’s high performance orientation before using SRL survey feedback, and how she was able to use SRL survey recommendations to lower her level of performance orientation and develop other, more adaptive ways of thinking.

### **BEFORE** using SRL survey resources and recommendations, **High Performance Orientation**:

For the spring semester of her first year at college, Janet tried to only enroll in easy courses. She had earned A’s and B’s during the fall semester and really wanted to maintain her GPA, so she couldn’t risk taking any challenging classes. Most of her courses were not very interesting, but Janet reminded herself that the most important thing was to do well.

> Janet is focusing only on ways to ensure high grades, so she took uninteresting but easy courses. How might her course choices be different if she was more focused on learning and mastery?

As the semester continued, Janet wasn’t enjoying her classes, and to be honest, she wasn’t enjoying the whole school experience. She felt very anxious to perform well and was afraid her professors wouldn’t think she was smart. She was constantly comparing herself to her classmates and feeling inferior when others knew more than her. Originally, Janet had thought about becoming a nurse, but now she wasn’t sure she wanted to continue with her degree. The work was so stressful – why did she need all of this pressure? When registration for the next fall opened, Janet felt paralyzed. She had enough and was not sure if she wanted to go online to select courses.

> Janet feels anxious because she measures progress by comparing herself to others. How would she feel if she focused on her individual learning and improvement?


### **AFTER** using SRL survey resources and recommendations - **Low Performance Orientation**:

Luckily for Janet, she chose to take the SRL survey during the summer. When reviewing her SRL profile, she realized that her thinking was very similar to what is called a Performance Goal orientation. After looking at the *What Can I Do?* part of the feedback, Janet realized that is a better way of thinking about school. While Janet still wanted to earn good grades, she realized that it was not essential or important to focus her energy on outperforming others. What was most important was to simply learn – to become more knowledgeable and skilled – and to enjoy the process of learning to become a professional. Janet revisited her idea about becoming a nurse. She spoke with her advisor and chose courses to put herself back on track. The Anatomy and Physiology course was known to be challenging, but Janet reminded herself that if this course could help her become a good nurse. Thus, she wanted to learn that information – just to learn it for the sake of learning!

> Janet is taking steps to change her thinking about why she is learning.

Janet earned a B- on one of her first Anatomy and Physiology tests and was clearly discouraged. However, she felt that she learned more than what she actually showed on the test. She thought to herself, “I still want to earn at least a B+ in this course because grades matter. However, what is most important is to improve and to simply focus on learning and mastering all the concepts.” Janet did achieve her goal at the end of the semester. She was very satisfied with herself and actually felt more relaxed about the entire experience. It was the first time in a long while that she was actually enjoying school.

> Janet is using strategies, like setting personal goals, to focus on her individual learning and improvement.
