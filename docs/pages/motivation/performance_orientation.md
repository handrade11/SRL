## What is Performance Motivation?

Have you ever wondered certain things like, “Why am I working hard in this course?” or “What is it that pushes me to do try to perform well on something?” Learners can have many different reasons why they choose to engage in or work hard at a learning task – something educational psychologists call **goal orientation.** One type of goal orientation is a **performance orientation.** Learners with this type of orientation often want to perform well because they want to demonstrate that they are intelligent or capable. Whether they consciously think about it or not, these types of learners believe things like, “I am working hard in this course so that the professor thinks I’m intelligent” or “My primary focus is to do well on this project so that I get a high grade.” These learners tend to focus on the ***outcome*** (grades, recognition) of the learning task, and they often measure success by comparing themselves to others.

> Janet was studying very hard for the midterm exam in her Introductory Psychology course. “I’d better do the optional recommended readings before the test,” she thought, “I want to be really prepared so that I get one of the highest grades in my class.” Janet is very concerned about getting a high grade because she does not want her professor or family to think that she is dumb. After receiving her grade, the first thing she does is check the class average to compare her performance to others.

## How was performance orientation measured on the SRL survey?

The SRL survey assessed the level of your performance orientation. You were asked to respond to the following five statements:

1. It's important that others see me as intelligent.
2. I often try to show others how capable I am.
3. I want to show I am more able than others in my class.
4. I want to know more than other students.
5. It's important for me not to appear “stupid” to others.

Based on your responses to these items, you were categorized into one of three categories: **High, Medium,** and **Low**.

* **High Performance Orientation** means that you focus a lot on appearing intelligent to others, and you often want to perform well so that others know you are capable.

* **Medium Performance Orientation** means that you sometimes focus on appearing intelligent or capable to others. However, this may not be the strongest reason why you work hard at school.

* **Low Performance Orientation** means that you don’t think too much about appearing intelligent or capable to others. This is not your main reason for wanting to perform well in school.

## Now that I know more about my performance orientation, what can I do?

If you had a High or Medium Performance Goal orientation you strongly encourage you to click on both *How Can I Learn More?* tab as well as the *What Can I Do?* tab below. Although a performance goal orientation can help to motivate you at times, there is an alternative and perhaps more adaptive way of thinking about why you should be learning – something that is called a **Mastery Goal** orientation.

If you received a Low Performance orientation, you may still find some value in perusing these sections, particularly the *What Can I Do section*?

* Click on the links under **How Can I Learn More?** to learn more about the importance and relevance of performance and other types of goal orientations.

* Click on the links under **What Can I Do?** to learn about some strategies or suggestions about other types of goal orientations that may help you think about school in a different way
