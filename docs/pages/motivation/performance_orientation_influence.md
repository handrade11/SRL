As discussed in other sections, a person with a High Performance Goal orientation will often be motivated to get very high grades and to outperform their classmates. An important question to ask yourself is whether focusing on outcomes and grades relative to your classmates is a positive or negative thing?

There is no absolute or correct answer to this question. Most people would agree that focusing on doing well and getting high grades is a positive thing. When learners focus primarily on outcomes and grades, they may become motivated to try hard in school. Further, focusing on outcomes or grades can also be a good way for students to figure out if they are doing well in school.

The problem arises when people worry too much about outcomes and outperforming others, and/or when they become overly preoccupied with showing how smart they are. These types of learners tend to be very anxious. They will often have negative and self-defeating thoughts such as, “I am not smart enough” or “Other people are so much smarter than me.” As discussed in the SRL survey feedback on test anxiety, when people have these types of thoughts and feelings, they will often avoid, procrastinate, and may even feel paralyzed because they don’t know what to do.

If you had a High or Medium level of Performance Goal orientation, have you ever thought or felt this way before?

## How can goal orientation influence the way I think, feel, and act?

The following figure illustrates what it means to have HIGH, MEDIUM, or LOW performance orientation. It also will give you some ideas about the typical outcomes and feelings people might experience depending on their level of performance orientation. As you look at this figure, try to take note of what this might mean to you as a student.
