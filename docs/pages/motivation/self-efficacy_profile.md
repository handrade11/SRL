The scenario below explores the self-efficacy profile of a college student, Allison. Click on the links below to read about Allison’s performance in her writing class, and how her self-efficacy improves by using SRL survey resources and recommendations. You can click on her thinking before and after using SRL survey feedback. As you read both of these scenarios, notice how Allison’s experiences change as a result of her shifting self-efficacy.

### BEFORE receiving SRL feedback – Alison had LOW self-efficacy:

Allison has been putting off her college writing course requirement for as long as possible, and was forced to enroll in the online version this semester. Allison has taken an online course only one time before; she did not perform as well as she hoped and her low grade discouraged her. Allison had difficulty understanding the material and assignments and she often thought, “This is too hard, I can’t do this! I don’t understand how this online course works and I never have time to finish my work” Now Alison is forced to take the online writing course, yet she feels very uncertain about her ability to succeed in the new course.

> Allison is doubting her abilities and discouraging herself by engaging in negative self-talk. 
> 
> Think about how this would look if Allison tried using the strategy Positive Self Talk

Additionally, Allison is concerned with her writing ability. She has previously received poor grades on papers but was confused because she thought she had done well. Between the frustration with her writing ability and uncertainty about online learning, Allison begins the online writing course thinking “this is going to be so hard, why bother?”

> Allison is looking at the overall picture of poor grades on papers, leading her to believe she won’t do well. It might be helpful if she used the strategy of Separating Feedback into Components

Throughout the course Allison would often give up quickly when she got stuck on assignments. She also often felt frustrated when experiencing difficulty accessing and understanding the material, and avoided extra credit assignments that could improve her grade --she thought she could not do them anyway so why bother.

> Allison doesn’t understand the material and gives up quickly. Her experience might change if she were to use strategies like Break Down the Task, Develop a Growth Mindset, and Seek Help

### AFTER receiving SRL feedback – Alison had MEDIUM self-efficacy:

After taking the survey, Allison realized that her beliefs about her ability to perform many learning (her self-efficacy) was very negative. Allison decided to try to use some of the recommended strategies to improve her self-efficacy.  Before her next paper was due, Allison decided to first, change negative thinking into positive thoughts; instead of thinking “This is going to be too hard, I don’t care how I do,” she decided to think, “I can do this; it’s not impossible. I’m going to successfully complete this paper!”

> Allison realized that she could start changing some things. This is a process; it won’t all change at once

After changing her some of her thinking, she thought more about her writing skills and realized she had received some positive feedback about certain aspects of her writing. She began to write down all of the positive things in her writing.  She also realized that she typically performed better on papers where she first had to write an outline. For her next essay, she decided to draft an outline and share it with her teacher. Her teacher verified that she was on the right track and gave her some writing tips, which increased Allison’s confidence that she could successfully write the paper.

> Allison tried some of the SRL survey recommended strategies and began to have more success and confidence. Review and Record outcomes helped Allison identify the positive aspects in her writing. She took time to Learn Strategies to Use when writing a paper, beginning with an outline. She tried to Practice and Get Feeedback (writing an outline and sharing with her teacher

While writing the paper, Allison continued to hit obstacles and sometimes felt as though she wanted to give up; she would say “I knew this would be too hard, it’s just like last time!” However, when Allison would feel unsure of herself and her abilities, she would again use positive self-talk to remind herself of how far she had come since beginning the assignment. These self-statements also helped her focus on doing well in the class.

> Allison continued to face challenges. Sometimes she would continue to engage in negative self-talk. “…I can’t do this!...”
> 
> Other times she would Use Positive Self Talk as a way to encourage and motivate herself

Throughout the course, Allison began to feel less frustrated and more prepared to tackle new writing assignments. Even though she would occasionally doubt her abilities, Allison felt she did not need to avoid writing assignments or online courses in the future. 

> Allison can continue to use the Recommendations and find new ways to improve her self-efficacy. This is a process; it won’t all change at once
