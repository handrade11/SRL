The scenario below explores the mindset profile of a fictional college
student, Ben. There are two scenarios:

* Ben exhibiting a FIXED mindset before taking the SRL survey
* Ben exhibiting a GROWTH mindset after using feedback and recommendations from the SRL survey

As you read the two scenarios, think about how Ben’s performance and behaviors in his science class varied depending on his mindset.

## **BEFORE** receiving SRL feedback – Ben used a **FIXED** mindset:

Ben recently took his midterm exam in his science class; he thought the exam was challenging but he did alright. When Ben received a very poor grade on the midterm, he was quick to label himself as “bad at science” and “a failure”.

> Ben is responding to his poor grade with a Fixed mindset. Think about what it would sound like if Ben adjusted his internal monologue to respond with a Growth mindset. 

Ben decided he did not have the knowledge or ability to do well on the upcoming final, and thought that no amount of effort and practice could change that.

> Ben should be aware that his Fixed mindset is influencing his reactions 

Ben continued to attend class, but became less motivated to pay attention and more withdrawn from the course with every class. Because of Ben’s lack of motivation, he did not use positive learning strategies to study for the final. Instead, he only aimed for a passing grade on the exam, and did not care if he retained the information, regardless of whether or not it would benefit him in future classes. By the end of the course, Ben felt frustrated, defeated, and was debating whether he had the ability to do well in school.

> Notice how Ben’s belief that his ability will not change led him to ponder whether he should drop out. What would happen if Ben exhibited a Growth Mindset? Would he value the information he learned?


## **AFTER** receiving SRL feedback – Ben began to adopt a **GROWTH** mindset:

Rewind to the moment after Ben received his poor midterm grade, when he decided he must be “bad at science” and started to give up. Because Ben realized that the SRL survey feedback was helpful in improving his strategic behaviors, he began looking at the Mindset feedback. Ben was shocked to learn that he was someone who has typically displayed a Fixed Mindset. But he wanted to change that: “Because I have done well in school at certain times, maybe I do have the ability – I just have not been that “intelligent” in how I prepared for the exam. I only studied the night before the exam and didn’t get much sleep. If I can change how I prepare, maybe I can do better.”

> In reading the feedback, Ben became aware of his Fixed mindset. He then reframed the failure in terms of factors he can control, which helped him to see how he can improve.

Ben continued to attend class, but occasionally found himself thinking he was “just not capable of doing well in science” and that “no matter how hard I try, I just can’t learn this material”. Ben told himself he needed to use a Growth mindset, and thought, “just remember that with some effort and practice I can learn this material and do well in science. I must be intelligent to get to where I am today”. He also used more positive learning strategies when studying for the final, and felt a newfound sense of confidence in his ability to succeed in future science classes.

> Ben became aware of when he was using a Fixed mindset and adjusted his internal monologue. This opened up his thinking to thinking more about strategies
