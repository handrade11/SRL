## What is Self-Efficacy? 

Self-efficacy simply refers to is a person’s beliefs in his or her ability to do something – it involves how confident that person is in being able to perform well or to exhibit certain behaviors. Students have self-efficacy for many different things like studying, writing an essay, performing mathematics problems and many other academic tasks. Read below about what Maria’s low self-efficacy for online learning looks like:

> Maria, a first year college student, was hesitant about enrolling in an online biology course. Although she possesses strong self-efficacy for reading, she was afraid that she wouldn’t understand the biology concepts without meeting face to face with an instructor to explain things – science had never been her strongest subject. The first class module was difficult for Maria, and she had a hard time understanding the topic. “I may as well give up now,” she thought, “Maybe this was a mistake.”

You can interpret the feedback about your self-efficacy in the following
way:

* ***HIGH*** – your confidence or belief in your ability to learn and to display effective behaviors in an online environment is strong

* ***MEDIUM*** - you likely have some confidence in these abilities, or your confidence varies across the different items

* ***LOW*** – you do not have much confidence in your ability to learn in an online context; you may have a lot of self-doubt

## Why is it important to have high self-efficacy? 

You may be wondering whether having high or low self-efficacy matters. This is a GREAT question to think about. Of greatest importance of you to realize at this point is that there is a ton of research showing that students with high levels of confidence in their skills and abilities tend to try harder, persist longer, and ultimately perform better in school that students who are not very confident.
