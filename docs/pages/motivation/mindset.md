**What is Growth and Fixed Mindset?**

Mindset refers to your beliefs about whether you think your intelligence or ability is fixed or if it can change over time. It refers to your *beliefs* about whether your intelligence or ability can improve. But you should recognize that it does NOT represent whether you are smart or not.

Generally speaking, there are two mindsets: **Fixed mindset** and **Growth mindset.**

* Learners with a **Fixed** mindset believe intelligence cannot be changed; they may see mistakes as a result of low ability or    intelligence which they believe cannot be changed. As a result, they tend to avoid challenging situations and are not sure about how to move forward from mistakes.

* Learners with a **Growth** mindset believe intelligence can be improved with effort; they tend to view mistakes as a normal part of learning and grow from challenges they encounter.

* Learners with a **Mixed** mindset may adopt either a Fixed or Growth mindset depending on the class, topic, or situation; they may also be unsure about whether or not their intelligence can change.

Read the brief scenarios about Ben and Nicole to get a better feel for these two mindsets:

> ***FIXED**: Ben recently received a poor grade on his science midterm and was quick to label himself as “bad at science” and “a failure”. Ben decided he was not capable of doing well on the final, and thought that no amount of effort and practice could change that; why would he put in the effort to study if it wouldn’t make a difference? Ben stopped paying attention in class, felt defeated, and barely studied for the final exam.*


> ***GROWTH:** Nicole took the same science midterm also received a poor grade. Nicole thought she must not have studied well enough. Although she was disappointed with the grade, Nicole understood that it she could improve her ability to learn if she puts in more effort and studies the material more thoroughly. Nicole took more detailed class notes, asked questions to clarify her confusions, and studied every week using study aids to help her master the material.*

## How was Mindset measured on the SRL survey?

The SRL survey measured both your Growth and Fixed mindset. You were asked to respond to the six statements. We combine your responses on the three Growth and three Fixed mindset statements to determine your Mindset profile. 

### Growth Mindset

* No matter who you are, you can significantly change your intelligence level.
* You can always greatly change how intelligent you are.
* No matter how much intelligence you have, you can always change it quite a bit.

### Fixed Mindset

* You have a certain amount of intelligence, and you can't really do much about it.
* Your intelligence is something about you that you can't change very much.
* You can learn new things, but you can't really change your basic intelligence.

## Why is it important to have a Growth mindset?

Improving your mindset is crucial for improving your academic achievement. When students exhibit a Fixed mindset tend to get anxious in school a lot and will often avoid things that are very difficult. They are also likely to give up when they struggle. But mindsets can change!

If you exhibited a Fixed Mindset, we encourage you to learn how to adopt a more Growth mindset. Learners with a Growth mindset tend to deal with failure and struggles in a much more effective way. They realize that gaining knowledge or skills is often more important than achieving good grades. They also tend to be more strategic and are more likely to take on difficult tasks and challenges than people who do not have a Growth Mindset.
