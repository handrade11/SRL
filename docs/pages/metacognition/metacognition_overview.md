summary: "Metacognition depicts your ability to “think about your thinking.” It requires you to plan (set realistic learning goals), monitor (track your progress towards those goals), adapt (changes your learning strategy when goal achievement is impeded), and evaluate (upon completion of a task, compare your performance to the initial goals)."

## Metacognition: Planning, Monitoring, and Evaluation

Have you ever procrastinated on an “easy” assignment only to find out you didn’t have enough time to finish it? (*Planning*) Or read course material then suddenly thought, “What did I just read?” (*Monitoring*). Have you ever finished a test and thought “I did pretty well!” only to receive a lower grade than you’d expected (*Evaluation*)? Skills in planning, monitoring, and evaluating your schoolwork are called **metacognition**. Metacognition is your awareness of and control over your thinking. These skills are important because they help people identify when things are go well or not and how they might need to adapt in order to improve.

In this interactive figure, you can see how frequently you said you use metacognitive strategies to plan, monitor, and evaluate your thinking. You can click on the circles in the figure to explore your results and learn how you can improve your metacognitive skills to succeed in college.

**FREQUENT user** - uses many strategies to plan, monitor, or evaluate
performance on many learning tasks

**PARTIAL user** - may use some strategies intermittently or rely on
some strategies, but not others

**INFREQUENT user** - may not use many strategies to regulate thinking
when completing most learning tasks
