## What can I do when studying for a quiz or exam?

### Before studying ask yourself...

<p class='question'>“What am I supposed to learn? What does the instructor want me to take away from this?”</p>

> **WRITE** a list of the information you will be tested on. **ASK** yourself “Am I forgetting about any topics or course materials that I need to study?”

<p class='question'>“What do I already know and what would I like to learn?”</p>

> 1.  **BRAINSTORM** what you already know about the topic. **WRITE** down or verbally state the information from memory. Check the accuracy of this information with your class materials.
> 2.  **ASK** yourself “What do I want to learn? How do these topics relate to what I already know?”
> 3.  **WRITE** down goals for your studying so that you can return to them later.

<p class='question'>“What are some ways that I can accomplish this task?”</p>

> **BRAINSTORM** multiple approaches to studying.
> 
> If you have studied for a similar topic or test before, what study strategies worked best for you? Consider using flashcards or combining rewriting your class and/or reading notes into a study guide.


<p class='question'>“How much time do I have to complete this? How much time do I need?”</p>

> 1.  Start several days in advanced.
> 2.  Estimate how long studying will take you. Consider the goals for studying and different approaches you can take.
> 3.  Set aside regular times to work and set specific goals for each time period. Prioritize information to study and plan extra time for topics that you may struggle with.
> 4.  Take breaks and alternate topics when you feel tired or discouraged.
> 5.  Try to identify the types of things you do to procrastinate, and eliminate one type at a time.

<p class='question'>“How can I organize myself and my materials?”</p>

> 1.  Collect related course materials before you begin studying. Keep course materials in a binder and make sure you have class work from each class.
> 2.  If you feel overwhelmed by the material, stay calm, seek help from classmates or your teacher, and organize the information in a way that makes the most sense to you.


<p class='question'>“What resources do I have to complete the task?”</p>

> Resources:
> - Textbooks
> - Course lessons
> - Your teacher
> - Classmates
> 
> When studying, make sure to consult multiple course materials (e.g., class notes and textbook) to be sure you have a full understanding of the material you will be tested on.


### While studying ask yourself...
  
<p class='question'>“What strategies am I using that are or are not working well to help me learn?”</p>

> **WHEN** you get stuck, **ASK** yourself “Am I using the best method possible to study? Should I use a different approach?” Figure out what material you understand already so you know where to focus your studying.
> 
> *Try:*
> -   Generating questions to quiz yourself
> -   Reorganizing the information in a different way (e.g., list similarities between concepts in a Venn diagram)

<p class='question'>“What other resources could I use to complete this task?”</p>

> Resources:
> - Textbooks
> - Course lessons
> - Your teacher
> - Classmates
> 
> **WHEN** you get stuck, **ASK** yourself “Am I using all of these resources? Is there one I could use better?”

<p class='question'>“What is most challenging about this task? What can I do different at this point to address these challenges?”</p>

> **ASK** yourself “What am I having trouble with?” so you know where to pay more attention. > 
> **BRAINSTORM** ways to overcome these challenges instead of continuing to run into the same obstacles. Seek help if you cannot find a solution on your own or before you start another assignment of the same type.

<p class='question'>“Am I meeting my learning goals?”</p>

> **ASK** yourself “What have I learned? Does what I learned match my learning goals? If not, where did I diverge from my goals and how can I get back on track?”
> 
> *To check what your understanding of the material, try:*
> - Writing or verbally stating information from memory. Compare this information to course materials to verify its accuracy.
> - Ask others to quiz you.


### After studying ask yourself...

<p class='question'>“How well did I accomplish the goals of the assignment? What did I learn?”</p>

> 1. **ASK** yourself “Did I meet my study goals? Did I learn what I set out to?”
> 2. If your answer is “No” try to meet your goals before taking the test. Also, make note of the topics you still have to learn and revisit these in the future. You can also reach out to your professor or use other resources to learn this material.

<p class='question'>“What did I do that worked well? What should I change”</p>

> 1.  **ASK** yourself “Did one learning strategy work better than others?” Maybe making flashcards worked well, but skimming the textbook did not help your comprehension.
> 2.  **ASK** yourself “Did I perform better on one part of the test than others (e.g., type of question, topic)?”
> 3.  **WRITE** down effective strategies and areas for improvements. You can also write a reminder on a calendar to return to this list the next time you have a test or quiz.

<p class='question'>“What topics am I still confused about that I need to clarify? How can I get my questions answered?”</p>

> 1.  Recognize concepts you still need to master – it is likely that these concepts will come up again throughout the course of your education.
> 2.  Use your resources (e.g., ask a teacher, read the textbook) to clarify confusions before attempting another assignment of this type.
