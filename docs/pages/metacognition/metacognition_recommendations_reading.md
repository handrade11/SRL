## What can I do when completing course readings or lessons?

### Before reading ask yourself...

<p class='question'>“What am I supposed to learn? What does the instructor want me to take away from this?”</p>

> Do you understand what the reading or lesson is asking you to do? For instance, are you supposed to skim the reading for general concepts, or are there guided reading questions that you need to answer along the way?

<p class='question'>“What do I already know and what would I like to learn?”</p>

> 1.  **BRAINSTORM** what you already know about the topic of the reading/lesson. **WRITE** down or verbally state the information from memory.
> 2.  **ASK** yourself “What do I want to learn? What skills would I like to take away from this reading/lesson?”
> 3.  **WRITE** down these goals so that you can return to them later.

<p class='question'>“What are some ways that I can accomplish this task?”</p>

> **BRAINSTORM** multiple approaches to accomplish the reading/lesson. If you have seen this type of reading/lesson before, what strategies worked best for you? Consider approaches such as summarizing each chapter or section of a lesson before moving onto the next.

*“How much time do I have to complete this? How much time do I need?”</p>

> 1.  Start several days in advanced.
> 2.  Estimate how long the reading/lesson will take you. Consider the goals of the reading/lesson and different approaches you can take.
> 3.  Set aside regular times to work and set specific goals for each time period. Plan in extra time for obstacles, such as looking up terms in other resources before you can understand a reading or technological issues that may prevent you from accessing course content.
> 4.  Try to identify the types of things you do to procrastinate, and eliminate one type at a time.

<p class='question'>“How can I organize myself and my materials?”</p>

> 1.  Collect related course materials before beginning a reading or lesson. Keep course materials in a binder and make sure you have class work from each class.
> 2.  If you feel overwhelmed by the material, use a graphic organizer or flow chart to connect your thoughts and course material. Re-writing the material can help you organize content.

<p class='question'>“What resources do I have to complete the task?”</p>

> Resources:
> - Textbooks
> - Course lessons
> - Your teacher
> - Classmates
>  
> For instance, if you encounter technological difficulties, are there numbers you can call for help, rather than simply stopping the assignment?


### While reading ask yourself...

<p class='question'>“What strategies am I using that are or are not working well to help me learn?”</p>

> **WHEN** you get stuck, **ASK** yourself “Am I using the best method possible to complete this reading/lesson? Should I use a different approach?” You can adjust how fast or slow you are reading the text, eliminate distractions from your environment, and consciously focus your thoughts on the task, rather than other things on your mind.
> 
> **WHEN** reading, **ASK** yourself “What did I just read?” Summarize the reading or generate questions based on the reading to check your comprehension.


<p class='question'>“What other resources could I use to complete this task?”</p>

> Resources:
> -   Textbooks
> -   Course lessons
> -   Your teacher
> -   Classmates
> 
> **WHEN** you get stuck, **ASK** yourself “Am I using all of these resources? Is there one I could use better?”

<p class='question'>“What is most challenging about this task? What can I do different at this point to address these challenges?”</p>

> **ASK** yourself “What am I having trouble with?” **BRAINSTORM** ways to overcome these challenges instead of continuing to run into the same obstacles. Seek help if you cannot find a solution on your own or before you start another assignment of the same type.

<p class='question'>“Am I meeting my learning goals?”</p>

> **ASK** yourself “Am I meeting the goals of this reading/lesson? Am I focusing on areas or topics where I want to learn more? If not, where did I diverge from my goals and how can I get back on track?”
> 
> **WRITE** or verbally state the information you have learned and check the accuracy of this information with your course materials.

### After reading ask yourself...

<p class='question'>“How well did I accomplish the goals of the assignment? What did I learn?”</p>

> 1.  **ASK** yourself “Did I accomplish the goals of this reading/lesson? Did I learn what I set out to?” Check your comprehension by quizzing yourself or writing down the information you have learned and checking its accuracy with course materials.
> 
> 2.  If your answer is “No”, look back to the reading or lesson to try again. Also, make note of the topics you still have to learn and revisit these in the future. You can also reach out to your professor or use other resources to accomplish these goals.


<p class='question'>“What did I do that worked well? What should I change”</p>

> 1.  **ASK** yourself “Did one learning strategy work better than others?”
> 2.  **ASK** yourself “Did I perform better on one part of the lesson than others?” Maybe you understood the general ideas but had difficulties with the details.
> 3.  **WRITE** down effective strategies and areas for improvements. You can also write a reminder on a calendar to return to this list the next time you have a similar assignment.

<p class='question'>“What topics am I still confused about that I need to clarify? How can I get my questions answered?”</p>

> 1.  Recognize concepts you still need to master – it is likely that these concepts will come up again throughout the course of your education.
> 2.  Use your resources (e.g., ask a teacher, read the textbook) to clarify confusions before attempting another reading or lesson.
