### What Does a Good Evaluator Do?

Effective evaluators will frequently reflect on their performances in
school so that they can improve their learning in the future. They will
frequently ask themselves, “What about my studying did or did not go
well?” The answers to this simple question can help students pinpoint
what strategies works well and which strategies do not.

> History exam of the semester. Often after an exam Anthony thinks to
> himself, “I know how well I did on that exam; I’m content with my
> grade.” He thinks and reflects on the material he learned and is
> confident about having learned all of the necessary material. However,
> he has a set way of studying and does not think about easier or better
> ways to study for different exams and often does not reflect on what
> went well and what didn’t well with studying. Therefore, Anthony
> sometimes feels stuck or overwhelmed when beginning to study for his
> next exam, as he doesn’t really know the best way to study for an
> exam, he only knows one way.
