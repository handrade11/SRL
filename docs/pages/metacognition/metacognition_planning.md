## Planning

### What Does a Good Planner Do?

Effective planners think before taking action or completing their work.
They ask themselves what the already know about a task, what is required
of them to complete the task, and how they can best go about
accomplishing the task.

> various assignments, quizzes, and projects. Sophia then began to
> transfer these assignments to her planner, where she wrote each
> assignment on the date it was due. After completing this, Sophia then
> began to schedule time to work on each assignment, allowing herself
> enough time to complete the assignment a few days before its actual
> due date. “Wow! I have a lot of assignments for this class,” she
> thought, “It’s a good thing I’m planning the semester now. I wouldn’t
> want to fall behind.”*
