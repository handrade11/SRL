## What can I do when writing a paper or completing an assignment?

### Before beginning the assignment ask yourself...

<p class='question'>“What am I supposed to learn? What does the instructor want me to take away from this?”</p>

> Do you understand what the assignment is asking you to do? For example, is your paper supposed to be a narrative of your experiences or is it a research paper using peer-reviewed articles?

<p class='question'>“What do I already know and what would I like to learn?”</p> 

> 1.  **BRAINSTORM** what you already know about the topic of the assignment. **WRITE** down or verbally state the information from memory.
> 2.  **ASK** yourself “What do I want to learn? What skills would I like to take away from this assignment?”
> 3.  **WRITE** down these goals so that you can return to them later.

<p class='question'>“What are some ways that I can accomplish this task?”</p>                                                      

> **BRAINSTORM** multiple approaches to the assignment. If you have seen this type of assignment before, what strategies worked best for you? Consider approaches such as making an outline to organize your thoughts.

<p class='question'>“How much time do I have to complete this? How much time do I need?”</p>

> 1.  Start several days in advanced.
> 2.  Estimate how long the assignment will take you. Consider the goals of the assignment and different approaches you can take.
> 3.  Set aside regular times to work and set specific goals for each time period. Plan in extra time for certain approaches, such as writing an outline before writing a paper.
> 4.  Try to identify the types of things you do to procrastinate, and eliminate one type at a time.

<p class='question'>“How can I organize myself and my materials?”</p>

> 1.  Collect related course materials before beginning an assignment. Keep course materials in a binder and make sure you have class work from each class.
> 2.  If you feel overwhelmed by the material, use a graphic organizer or flow chart to connect your thoughts and course material. Re-writing the material can help you organize content.

<p class='question'>“What resources do I have to complete the task?”</p>

> Resources:
> - Textbooks
> - Course lessons
> - Your teacher
> - Classmates
> 
> When writing a paper, it may be useful to consult multiple sources on a topic (e.g., your class notes, textbook, and classmates) to ensure you have all the necessary information before writing about it.


### While working on an assignment ask yourself...

<p class='question'>“What strategies am I using that are or are not working well to help me learn?”</p>

> **WHEN** you get stuck, **ASK** yourself “Am I using the best method possible to write this paper? Should I use a different approach?”
>
> For example, if using an outline did not help, you can organize your thoughts in a flow chart or other graphic organizer.

<p class='question'>“What other resources could I use to complete this task?”</p>

> Resources:
> Textbooks
> - Course lessons
> - Your teacher
> - Classmates
> 
> **WHEN** you get stuck, **ASK** yourself “Am I using all of these resources? Is there one I could use better?”

<p class='question'>“What is most challenging about this task? What can I do different at this point to address these challenges?”</p>

> **ASK** yourself “What am I having trouble with?” so you know where to pay more attention. > 
> **BRAINSTORM** ways to overcome these challenges instead of continuing to run into the same obstacles. Seek help if you cannot find a solution on your own or before you start another assignment of the same type.

<p class='question'>“Am I meeting my learning goals?”</p>                                        

> **ASK** yourself “Does what you have written for this assignment match the criteria for the assignment? Am I focusing on areas or topics where I want to learn more? If not, where did I diverge from my goals and how can I get back on track?”


### After completing an assignment ask yourself...

<p class='question'>“How well did I accomplish the goals of the assignment? What did I learn?”</p>

> 1.  **ASK** yourself “Did I accomplish the assignment’s goals? Did I learn what I set out to?”
> 2.  If your answer is “No” try to meet your goals before submitting the assignment. Also, make note of the topics you still have to learn and revisit these in the future. You can also reach out to your professor or use other resources to accomplish these goals.

<p class='question'>“What did I do that worked well? What should I change”</p>

> 1.  **ASK** yourself “Did one learning strategy work better than others?”
> 2.  **ASK** yourself “Did I perform better on one part of the assignment than others?” Maybe your outline was great, but the written paper was not your highest quality work.
> 3.  **WRITE** down effective strategies and areas for improvements. You can also write a reminder on a calendar to return to this list the next time you have a similar assignment.
                                                                                                                                                                   
<p class='question'>“What topics am I still confused about that I need to clarify? How can I get my questions answered?”</p>

> 1.  Recognize concepts you still need to master – it is likely that these concepts will come up again throughout the course of your education.
> 2.  Use your resources (e.g., ask a teacher, read the textbook) to clarify confusions before attempting another assignment of this type.
