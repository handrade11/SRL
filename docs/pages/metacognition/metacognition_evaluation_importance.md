In school, and in life, there will always be many opportunities for you
to evaluate – that is, to ask yourself how well you performed something.
For example, you may evaluate when:

* you finish reading a chapter in a textbook
* after solving a math problem as part of homework
* you receive a test grade back from a teacher

Regardless of the specific “evaluation moment”, you will be likely to repeat the same mistakes again and again if you do not have a clear and accurate sense of how you actually performed.

Becoming an effective evaluator is important and is like being “mini-detective” about schoolwork – it enables you to piece together a puzzle so that you can identify what worked, what did not work, and, hopefully, what needs to be done to improve.
