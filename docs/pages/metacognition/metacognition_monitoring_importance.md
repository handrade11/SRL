It is inevitable that you will encounter some challenges while completing your schoolwork. For example:

* you might have difficulty understanding what you read from a textbook
* you may struggle to solve certain types of mathematics problems.
* you may not also be able to clearly express your thoughts in writing

You may also do some things that are not very effective - and you do not even realize that they are ineffective. For example:

* you may use the same types of strategies for all your classes even when other strategies might be more effective.
* you might begin assignments without realizing that you are not doing things correctly

By learning how monitor your learning strategies and skills more frequently, you can avoid these types challenges and become empowered to take control of your schoolwork.
