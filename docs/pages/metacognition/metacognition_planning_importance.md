Homework assignments, projects, reading, and studying can take a lot of time and effort. In addition, some assignments can be complex and difficult to figure out. When you do not plan or think head regarding your schoolwork, you might:

* not fully understand what is being asked of you
* underestimate how long the assignment will take
* waste time working on the wrong things
* run out of time
* not use the learning strategies that are needed to perform well

Learning how to become a better planner will not only help you to avoid some of these challenges, it can increase your confidence in being able to handle the challenges of school.
