The figure below shows the metacognitive profile of a fictional college student, Ryan. Click on the links below to read about what Ryan was like before using SRL SURVEY feedback and after he began working with this feedback system over time. 

> Ryan is a 40 year old male who recently enrolled at Excelsior. He is taking classes part-time while he continues his job as a business consultant for a technology company.  After returning home from work at 5:30pm, Ryan typically spends time with his two children (ages 4 and 7), eats dinner with his family, and helps his wife with baths and bedtime. He is only able to start his schoolwork after 8:30pm, when the children are asleep.

### Ryan’s metacognitive strategy use before using SRL Survey recommendations:

Ryan is very busy with his family and work responsibilities. He can do his schoolwork and study for his exam after children go to sleep – about 8:30pm or so. He constantly feels rushed and worries that he just does not have the necessary time to get through all of study material. Although some of his friends told him that he needs to plan better, Ryan told them that he has no time to plan and that it was a waste of his time. **(Infrequent Planning)**.

> Ryan demonstrates weak planning skills, which results confusion and poor time management.
> 
> How would things look if Ryan thought to himself “How much time do I have to complete this? How much time do I need?” or “How can I organize myself and my materials?”

As he prepares for his next test, Ryan is fairly adept at noticing when his thoughts wander and when he is getting confused. To keep himself aware of his learning, he tries to stops at the end of each section of the study guide to ask, “Do I understand what I just studied?” Further, in order to check his comprehension during studying, Ryan typically wants to quiz himself. Unfortunately, because he does not really plan out his study sessions he tends to not be able to do all of the things that he thinks he can do. **(Frequent Monitoring)**.

> Ryan’s strength is his ability to monitor his learning. 
> 
> Ryan already thinks to himself “Am I meeting my learning goals?” and “What strategies am I using that are or are not working well to help me learn? What if he also thought “What other resources could I use to complete this task?

Although Ryan does a good job of trying to keep track of his learning during studying, he rarely reflects on how effectively he learns. As soon as Ryan finished studying the day before the test, he felt good because of how hard he was trying. He believed that he would do fine on the test because of how much he studied and seemed to be learning things well. When Ryan received feedback about his test about a week later, he was shocked and upset. He received a 74. He couldn’t believe it and began to question whether staying in school was even worth it. **(Infrequent Evaluation)**.

> Ryan does not routinely reflect on and evaluate the quality of his study approach.
> 
> How might Ryan’s reaction differ if he freqeuntly thought, “What did I do that worked well? What should I change?”

### Ryan’s metacognitive strategy use *after* using SRL SURVEY recommendations:

Upon completing the SRL survey and reviewing the different parts of the feedback, Ryan began to re-think his approach to school over the next few weeks. Rather than waiting until the day before the exam to study he began to devote small segments of time each night. He also looked the syllabus and study guide well in advance of tests so that he can figure out what might be the best way to study. He got some of these ideas about how to plan from the SRL SURVEY feedback system and actually reached out to his advisor to ask some questions about how he might become a better planner. He never realized that by preparing and thinking ahead he would actually become more relaxed and confident as a student  **(Frequent Planning)**.

> Ryan has learned that devoting time to plan an activity can actually save him time.
> 
> Ryan used multiple recommendations, “How much time do I have to complete this? How much time do I need?” and “How can I organize myself and my materials?” and “What resources do I have to complete this task”

Although Ryan was a frequent monitor before the SRL SURVEY experience, he has learned to become even more skilled. He not only tries to monitor how well he is learning during studying, he has also begun to track whether his study plan and approach works well. In general, Ryan is becoming more aware of the things that cause him to do well or poorly in school and tries to keep track of these things in a journal. When speaking with his advisor, Ryan also learned that creating a list of what he already knows and what he would like to learn could be helpful with keeping him on track while studying **(Frequent Monitoring)**.

> Ryan realized that despite his strong monitoring skills, he still has room for improvement.
> 
> He tried new recommendations that he previously was unaware of, “What other resources could I use to complete this task? and “What is most challenging about this task? What can I do different at this point to address these challenges?”

One of the habits that Ryan has developed jotting down key points about what he’s learned or short summaries of each topic after learning. This helps him to more thoroughly check his understanding. Ryan also writes down the strategies he uses to study (note cards, videos, outlining chapters, reading class notes, etc.). Using these evaluation tactics are important because it not only increases his awareness of the things he did to prepare for this tests, he will also have a better sense of what he might need change or adapt do when preparing for the next test **(Partial Evaluating)**.

> Ryan has learned some strategies to evaluate his performance after studying and after taking an exam
> 
> Ryan used the recommendations tool box to guide his evaluating thinking, “How well did I accomplish the goals of the assignment? What did I learn?” and “What did I do that worked well? What should I change?”
