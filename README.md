### Building the Site

This site is created using the [Jekyll Documentation Theme](http://idratherbewriting.com/documentation-theme-jekyll/) and hosted by [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

To build the site locally run the following command:

```
jekyll build --source docs --destination build
```

Alternatively, you can run a local web server with the following command (available at http://localhost:4000):

```
jekyll server --source docs --destination build
```

### Editting

The source of main content of the website is located in the [https://github.com/ExcelsiorCollege/SRL/tree/master/docs/pages](docs/pages) directory. Content is in Markdown format and converted to HTML either by the Jekyll commands above or when committed to Github. Each page contains metadata (surrounded by `---`) that provides information when the Markdown document is converted to the website format. The following parameters are accepted:

* `title` - The page title.
* `tags` - List of tags for the page (optional).
* `keywords` - List of keywords for the page (optional).
* `summary` - A summary of the page (optional).
* `sidebar` - The name of the navigation sidebar. This should be `mydoc_sidebar` for all of the self-regulated learning pages.
* `permalink` - The name of the HTML file that will be generated. Typically, this is the same name as the Markdown file with a `.html` file extension.
* `folder` - The name of the folder the source file is located. This is used to ensure the `Edit Me` buttons points to the correct source file.
* `toc` - Should a table of contents be created for the page.

#### Markdown

The goal of markdown is to write content that looks reasonable in plain text but can be converted to HTML easily. As such, Markdown is a simple markup langauge. [Click here](Markdown.md) for a list of common Markdown featues.

Since the documents here will be converted to HTML you can use any valid HTML tags as well although discouraged.
